# MapMarker_Application

**Specification**

The purpose of this assignment is to give you practical experience with Google Maps and/or Google Location services.  
One of the most important features of Mobile technologies is the ability for devices to “know where they are” and to make 
that information available as part of a real-time processing system.  Because location services have changed significantly 
over the evolution of the Android OS, I think that it is best if students focus on the latest API.  Unless you have good 
reason to target earlier APIs (you will be limited if you do because much of it is deprecated), please focus on the most 
current implimentations. 

**Requirements**

1.Your application must make use of your current location as part of its computation
2.Your application must make use of Google Maps to either show your current location or an intended location (or both).
3.Your application must use location information as part of a calculation/computation.  
  For example, it could compute the distance between your current location and an intended location, 
  it could compute speed, or it could compute time to get to an intendedlocation.
4.Your application must check to see that location services are enabled on the device and respond appropriately if they 
are not. (eg, notify the user and provide a button that brings up the settings for location services.
5.Location services will not work if you do not apply for an API key from google.  Your application must have a 
valid API key
